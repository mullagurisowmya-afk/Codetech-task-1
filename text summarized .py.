✅ Task Objective:

Create a tool that summarizes lengthy articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.


---

🔧 Requirements (from poster):

1. Create a Python script.


2. Use NLP techniques to summarize input text.


3. The script must accept input and produce a concise summary.




---

🧠 Approach Options:

There are two main types of summarization:

Extractive summarization – selects important sentences from the original text.

Abstractive summarization – rewrites the text in a shorter form, like how a human would.


For this task, you can start with Extractive summarization, which is easier to implement.

🧰 Tools & Libraries You Can Use:

nltk

sumy

spacy

transformers (for advanced models like BERT, T5)

gensim

BeautifulSoup (optional, for web scraping articles)

✍️ Sample Python Script (Extractive Summarization using NLTK):

import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize, word_tokenize
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from string import punctuation

# Download required resources
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')

def summarize_text(text, num_sentences=3):
    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english') + list(punctuation))
    words = word_tokenize(text.lower())

    # Create frequency table
    freq_table = {}
    for word in words:
        if word not in stop_words:
            freq_table[word] = freq_table.get(word, 0) + 1

    # Score sentences
    sentences = sent_tokenize(text)
    sentence_scores = {}
    for sentence in sentences:
        for word in word_tokenize(sentence.lower()):
            if word in freq_table:
                sentence_scores[sentence] = sentence_scores.get(sentence, 0) + freq_table[word]

    # Select top sentences
    summary_sentences = sorted(sentence_scores, key=sentence_scores.get, reverse=True)[:num_sentences]
    summary = ' '.join(summary_sentences)
    return summary

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    article = """Your long article text here..."""
    print("Summary:")
    print(summarize_text(article))


---

🚀 Advanced Option: Abstractive Summarization using Hugging Face Transformers

from transformers import pipeline

# Load summarization pipeline
summarizer = pipeline("summarization")

# Input text
text = """Your long article here..."""

# Generate summary
summary = summarizer(text, max_length=130, min_length=30, do_sample=False)
print("Summary:", summary[0]['summary_text'])

To run this, install the Transformers library first:

pip install transformers


---

📦 Deliverable Format:

A Python file: text_summarizer.py

Include:

Clear comments

Sample input text and generated summary

Optionally, accept input from a .txt file




---

✅ Example Output:

Input:

> "Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines..."



Summary:

> "AI simulates human intelligence in machines and includes learning and problem-solving."
